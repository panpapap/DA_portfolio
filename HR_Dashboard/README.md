# HR Dashboard
I have built a dashboard, and analytics pages for HR department of a dummy company. The main goals of this dashboard is to look for Employees promotion due, as well as finding the employees that should be retrenched. Other information could also be found in the detail page.

You could look at the Dashboard [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l7-Tq1TMOwjns3VDeK5aDZlm2ogwJTC1/view?usp=sharing)
